# üìÉ Functions Library Documentation

This documentation outlines the structure and functionality of the custom functions library used in the application. The library is divided into three main segments: `Util`, `Helper`, and `Do`. Each segment targets different aspects of the application, from utility functions to specialized helpers and direct action methods.

## Util

The `Util` segment is designed to provide utility functions that simplify common operations, such as database interactions and data manipulation.

### Other

- **`twJoin` and `twMerge`**: Utility functions from `tailwind-merge` for handling Tailwind CSS class mergers and conditionals.
- **`returnHandle`**: A higher-order function designed to streamline asynchronous operations, handling both the success and error paths with custom messages.

### Clerk

- **`getClerkId`**: Retrieves the Clerk user ID, ensuring the user is authenticated.

### DataBase

Provides a set of functions to interact with the database entities like `Organ`, `User`, `Lead`, `Chat`, and `Message`.

#### Organ

- **`pushOrgan`**: Creates a new organ entry in the database.
- **`popOrgan`**: Deletes a specified organ entry by its ID.
- **`getOrgan`**: Retrieves a specific organ entry by its ID.
- **`popOrgans`**: Deletes all organ entries.
- **`getOrgans`**: Fetches all organ entries.

#### User

- **`pushUser`**: Adds a new user to the database, linking it to an organ.
- **`getUser`**: Retrieves a user by their Clerk ID.

#### Lead

- **`pushLead`**: Adds a new lead, optionally linking it to an organ and including contact information.

#### Message

- **`pushMessage`**: Adds a new message to a chat.
- **`popMessage`**: Deletes a specific message by ID.

## Helper

The `Helper` segment is focused on providing support functions that integrate external services or complex logic not directly related to database operations.

### Chat

- **`getAiResponse`**: Interacts with an AI service to get responses based on a lead's message. It handles thread creation and message logging within the chat.

## Do

`Do` includes functions that perform specific actions or business logic, often combining multiple utility functions to achieve a task.

### User

- **`Onboarding`**: Handles the onboarding process for new users, ensuring they are registered and linked to a new organ if necessary.

### Lead

- **`getLead`**: Retrieves details for a specific lead.
- **`getLeads`**: Fetches all leads associated with the user's organ.
